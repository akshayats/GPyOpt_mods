"""
This is a simple demo to demonstrate the use of Bayesian optimization for automatic
optimization of functions. All the default values of the parameters in GPyOPt are used. To run the example execute

>> import GPyOpt
>> GPyOpt.demos.automatic_optimization()

As a result you should see:

- A plot with the model and the current acquisition function, the Expected Improvement in this example.#
- A plot with the diagnostic plots of the optimization.
- An object call BO_demo_auto that contains the results of the optimization process (see reference manual for details). Amonng the available results you have access to the GP model via

>> BO_demo_auto.model

and to the location of the best found location writting.
